### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-03-andrew-yesenia-liam.git)

    The reason I chose lab 3 as one of my favorite lab assignments this semester is because to me it felt like really getting into coding for the first time. In this lab I learned all about making sure to define the terms that we were going to be using, using double statements, as well as calling functions. This assignment was also my first time working in a group of 3 so overall the lab was fun and less stressful. Because we were a group, I feel like this lab was beneficial for me since I was able to learn from my peers better.

* Lab 6 (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-eduardo-and-andrew.git)

    I enjoyed lab 6 because I really liked using the material covered in class within the program. For example, in part 1, we used input validation to ensure that the user is providing the proper amount of arguments. Lab 6 part 2 was also very fun too because we had to compute the scoring for blackjack hands which is a game I enjoy. In this program we learned how to use bool in place for true/false statements and I think this lab was really good at challenging us.

* Lab 7 (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-clayandandrew.git)

    Lab 7 was my most favorite lab of the entire semester. Within part 1, we learned the importance of arithmetic operators to properly calculate the number of days between different dates. Personally, the lab got even more fun in part 2 because we had to match up the legal parking times according to real street signs given and provide whether or not parking is valid which required a lot of input validation and bool statements to ensure that the program will work. Both parts of the assignment are very entertaining since they are used in real world situations frequently.
